# Football Match Object Detection (Players, Referees, Goalkeepers, and Ball)

This project aims to detect football players, referees, goalkeepers, and the ball in a football match using a YOLO (You Only Look Once) trained model. The video is captured from a tactical camera, which is often used for providing an overhead or strategic view of the game.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to process a video of a football match and use a YOLO-based object detection model to identify and classify the following objects:

- Players (footballers)
- Referees
- Goalkeepers
- Ball

The model is trained to handle video frames and can detect these objects in real-time, allowing for the analysis of player movements, game events, and overall match dynamics.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Process football match videos in real-time to detect players, referees, goalkeepers, and the ball.
- **Custom YOLO Model**: The YOLO model is specifically trained for this task to achieve high accuracy and speed in detecting football-related objects.
- **Tactical Camera Footage**: The model works with videos captured from a tactical camera, which provides a unique and strategic overhead view of the match.
- **Visualization**: The detected objects are highlighted in the video with bounding boxes and labels.
- **Easy to Use**: The project is designed to be simple to set up and run, making it accessible to researchers, analysts, and developers working in sports analytics or computer vision.
